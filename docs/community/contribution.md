## Contributing Code 

### Obtaining the Source Code and Building the Project

Refer [Source & Build](../../development/) section for details on obtaining the source code, building the projects, and for their relevant prerequisites.

### Making Code Changes and Sending PRs

You can use your preferred IDEs (eg: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) for development. Make sure, your IDE is configured with proper JDK and Maven settings (for working on java projects). 

You can import the source code to IDE, do code changes, and add the necessary unit tests. Finally, build the complete Siddhi project with tests, once build is successful, commit the changes to your Github folk following the below guidelines, and then send the pull request to the relevant Siddhi.io Repo.

### Code Commit Guidelines

We follow these commit message guidelines:

* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
* Capitalize the subject line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line
* Wrap the body at 72 characters
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

### Accepting Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Before you submit your first contribution please accept our Contributor License Agreement (CLA). When you send your first Pull Request (PR), GitHub will ask you to accept the CLA.

There is no need to do this before you send your first PR. Subsequent PRs will not require CLA acceptance.

If for some (unlikely) reason at any time CLA changes, you will get presented with the new CLA text on your first PR after the change.

## Proposing Changes or Improvements

You can propose changes or improvements by reporting an issue in the [Siddhi GitHub repository](https://github.com/siddhi-io/siddhi/issues) with the label `type/improvement` or `type/new-feature`. 

You can also start a thread in the [Siddhi-Dev Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/siddhi-dev) to continue the discussion in detail.
