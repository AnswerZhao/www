    [`10`, `5`, `30`, `on`]

    [`10`, `5`, `removed`]


#### Output

After processing the above input events, the event arriving at `RegulatorActionStream` will be as follows:

[`5`, `stop`]

At the same time, there will be an alert event arriving at `RoomTemperatureAlertStream` after the 30 seconds (from the first event):
