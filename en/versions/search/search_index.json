Output After processing, the event arriving at TemperatureOnlyStream will be emitted via log and kafka sinks. As log sink uses passThrough mapper by default, it directly logs the Siddhi Events to the console as following; Event{timestamp=1574515771712, data=[35.4], isExpired=false} The kafka sink maps the event to a custom JSON message as below and publishes it to the temperature topic. { temp : 35.4 } To output messages using other message formats, pleases refer the examples related to Output Data Mapping.","title":"Sources and sinks"},{"location":"docs/examples/streams-and-queries/","text":"var base_url = \"\"; Streams and Queries Provides introduction to streams , queries , and how queries can be chained to one another. There are multiple type of queries such as window query, join query, pattern query, etc. But this example only explains how pass-through and selection queries work.

The schema of the stream is inferred from the previous query, hence no need to be defined. select temperature insert into TemperatureOnlyStream; Selects only the temperature attribute from events, and outputs to TemperatureOnlyStream . Events at each stream When an event with values [ 'aq-14' , 35.4 ] is sent to InputTemperatureStream stream it will get converted and travel through the streams as below.
